# Bark Token Program

Bark Token (BARK) is a Solana-based token program built with the Anchor framework, implementing the Solana 2022-Token Standard (Solana Extension). This program is created to manage Bark Tokens, a digital asset on the Solana blockchain, and is driven by community contributions.

## Features:

- **Token Creation:** Create Bark Tokens with details such as name, symbol, and maximum supply.
- **Minting:** Mint additional Bark tokens to the existing supply.
- **Burning:** Burn Bark tokens to reduce the total supply.
- **Pausing:** Pause and resume Bark token transfers as needed.
- **Transaction Fees:** Collect transaction fees and distribute them to a "community" treasury wallet. The BarkÂ´s Solana 2022 Token "TransferFee" extension allows you to configure a transfer fee directly on the Mint Account, enabling fees to be collected at a protocol level. Every time tokens are transferred, the fee is set aside in the recipient's Token Account. This fee is untouchable by the recipient and can only be accessed by the withdrawal authority. The design of pooling transfer fees at the recipient account is meant to maximize the parallelization of transactions. Otherwise, one configured fee recipient account would be write-locked between parallel transfers, decreasing the throughput of the protocol.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install)
- [Anchor](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/installation.html)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bark-community/bark-token/bark-token-program.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd bark-token && bark-token-program
    ```

3. Build the program:

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

4. Deploy the program to Solana:

    ```bash
    solana program deploy target/deploy/bark_token.so
    ```

### Usage

1. Initialize the Bark Token:

    ```bash
    solana-tokens create-account <MINT_ADDRESS> <OWNER_ADDRESS> bark_token_program_id
    ```

2. Mint new tokens:

    ```bash
    solana-tokens mint <MINT_ADDRESS> <DEST_ADDRESS> <AMOUNT> --authority <AUTHORITY_ADDRESS>
    ```

3. Burn tokens:

    ```bash
    solana-tokens burn <MINT_ADDRESS> <SOURCE_ADDRESS> <AMOUNT> --authority <AUTHORITY_ADDRESS>
    ```

4. Change the paused state:

    ```bash
    solana-tokens change-paused-state --authority <AUTHORITY_ADDRESS> --state <STATE_ADDRESS> --paused <true/false>
    ```

5. Collect transaction fees:

    ```bash
    solana-tokens collect-fees --treasury <TREASURY_ADDRESS> --state <STATE_ADDRESS>
    ```
